# Machine Learning Cats and Dogs’ Breeds Classifier

This repository contains the **code** and the original **report** made for the [Machine Learning Topics](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/12832) course in the Informatics Engineering bachelor's degree I took. This project was made with Pedro Silva, you can check out his [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-silva-3b41a3221/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pmasilva20) profiles!

With the knowledge gained from this project, I decided to create an article in the form of a tutorial that you can check out [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-cats-and-dogs-breeds-classifier-b26a9df45000) (published in Towards Data Science!). This is my attempt to try to teach the world how to create a cat and dog’s breeds classifier using a machine learning model in Python.
